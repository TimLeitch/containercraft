# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ContainerCraft is a web-based application that simplifies Minecraft modpack server deployment and management through Docker containers. The system allows users to browse CurseForge modpacks, deploy servers with one click, and manage server configurations through an intelligent GUI that adapts to different configuration types. The application supports multiple concurrent servers, provides RCON integration for server commands, and enables configuration saving and reuse across deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Minecraft server administrator, I want to browse and select modpacks from CurseForge, so that I can easily discover and deploy popular modpack servers without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a browsable interface of CurseForge modpacks
2. WHEN the user searches for modpacks THEN the system SHALL filter results based on name, category, or popularity
3. WHEN the user selects a modpack THEN the system SHALL display modpack details including version, description, and mod list
4. IF a modpack has multiple versions THEN the system SHALL allow version selection before deployment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a server host, I want to launch a modpack server with one click, so that I can deploy servers quickly without Docker configuration knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Launch Server" on a selected modpack THEN the system SHALL automatically create and start a Docker container
2. WHEN the container is being created THEN the system SHALL display deployment progress and status
3. WHEN the server deployment completes THEN the system SHALL display the server management interface
4. IF the deployment fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and cleanup any partial deployments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to configure Minecraft and mod settings through an adaptive GUI, so that I can customize server behavior without editing configuration files manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is deployed THEN the system SHALL scan and parse all configuration files from Minecraft and installed mods
2. WHEN displaying configuration options THEN the system SHALL use appropriate UI controls (sliders for numeric ranges, toggles for booleans, dropdowns for enums)
3. WHEN a user modifies a configuration value THEN the system SHALL validate the input and update the server configuration in real-time
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL apply changes to the running server without requiring restart when possible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a server operator, I want to save and reuse server configurations, so that I can quickly deploy identical servers or backup my settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has configured a server THEN the system SHALL provide an option to save the configuration with a custom name
2. WHEN launching a new server THEN the system SHALL offer previously saved configurations as deployment templates
3. WHEN applying a saved configuration THEN the system SHALL restore all previously configured settings
4. WHEN configurations are saved THEN the system SHALL store them persistently across application restarts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to manage multiple servers simultaneously, so that I can run different modpacks or server instances concurrently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple servers are running THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard showing all active servers
2. WHEN viewing the server list THEN the system SHALL show server status, modpack name, player count, and resource usage
3. WHEN switching between servers THEN the system SHALL maintain separate configuration contexts for each server
4. WHEN a server is stopped THEN the system SHALL properly cleanup Docker containers and free resources

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a server operator, I want to execute commands on running servers through RCON, so that I can manage gameplay and server operations remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a server is running THEN the system SHALL provide an RCON command interface
2. WHEN the user enters a command THEN the system SHALL execute it on the target server and display the response
3. WHEN RCON connection fails THEN the system SHALL display connection status and retry options
4. WHEN executing commands THEN the system SHALL maintain a command history for easy reuse

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user on any platform, I want to access the application through a web browser on desktop or mobile, so that I can manage servers from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive web interface that works on desktop and mobile browsers
2. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface for touch interaction and smaller screens
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL work consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms
4. IF Docker Desktop is not installed THEN the system SHALL display clear installation instructions and requirements

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle Docker container lifecycle automatically, so that I don't need to manage containers manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a server is deployed THEN the system SHALL create Docker containers with appropriate networking and volume configurations
2. WHEN a server is stopped THEN the system SHALL properly stop and remove associated Docker containers
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL detect and reconnect to existing server containers
4. WHEN containers crash THEN the system SHALL detect failures and provide restart options
